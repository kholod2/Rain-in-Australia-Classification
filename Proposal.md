## Introduction

The climate of Australia varies widely across its eight states and territories; most of the country has four seasons, with a wet and dry season in the tropical north.
Rainfall in Australia is extremely varied, owing to the region's large-scale atmospheric and oceanic causes. In this project, we train classification models on the target variable RainTomorrow to predict next-day rain.

## Problem statement
Predict next-day rain by training classification models on the target variable RainTomorrow.
## Data Description
This dataset contains about 10 years of daily weather observations from many locations across Australia.
Observations were drawn from numerous weather stations. The daily observations are available from http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/data.
